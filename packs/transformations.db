{"name":"Blood Kiss (Miscellaneous Transformation Info)","permission":{"default":0,"kHr5wGqy2Rw4go1y":3},"flags":{},"content":"<h2>The Blood Kiss</h2>\n<p>You can continue to drain the blood of your quarry even when you have healed all Wounds and removed all Conditions, reducing your prey's ability to break free and slowly killing them in the process. These extra Wounds give you no benefit, but this is the first violent step in delivering the Blood Kiss. Sometimes, killing your victims is the best way to dispose of the evidence.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Fortitude</h2>\n<p>You are resistant to the effects of violence, torture and suffering. These do not cause new Psychology Traits or Mental&nbsp;Corruption. Failed or fumbled Psychology Tests have no long-lasting consequences either.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Fear</h2>\n<p>As a result of your Vampiric nature, you are also immune to Fear up to and including your own Fear Rating. Vampires are also immune to Psychology from their own Undead and Ghoul armies. A Vampire who commands a Terrorgheist does not have to worry about how terrifying it is; you already know and that's why you brought it into battle.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Disease &amp; Poison</h2>\n<p>Vampires are typically immune to the effects of most diseases and poisons, but they can become carriers of disease and they can suffer the Poisoned Condition from Sunlight. Carriers of diseases gain the @Compendium[wfrp4e-vampires.vampires-talents.Q20IGcUy27r4azD8]{Diseased (Type)} Blood Gift and may pass this disease onto their victims when feeding. The @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.talents.vMYEkrWj0ip6ZOdv]{Resistance (Disease)} Talent prevents you from being a carrier, meaning you may never take the Diseased Blood Gift.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Infected</h2>\n<p>Vampires with the Infected Blood Gift harbour filthy bugs in their mouths and on their claws, and thus increase the risk of Festering Wounds. This is typically as a result of feeding from corpses or vermin, or keeping unsanitary conditions in your lair. The effects of the Infected and Diseased Blood Gifts stack, if you are unlucky or malicious enough to take both.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Gluttony</h2>\n<p>Drinking blood can be addictive for Vampires. For this reason, gratuitous feeding is frowned upon &mdash; although bathing in blood is not. If you drink more than 12 times in one night, you must pass a <strong>Challenging (+0) Cool Test</strong>. If you fail, roll against the Mental Corruption Table. The Difficulty of this Test increases by one step for every additional time you feed that night.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Sleep</h2>\n<p>You find it difficult to stay awake during the day. Vampiric sleep is a death-like state where your body lies like a perfectly preserved corpse.</p>\n<p>You can only stay awake a maximum number of hours past sunrise equal to half your Willpower Bonus, but doing so requires a <strong>Challenging (+0) Endurance Test</strong> every hour.</p>\n<p>You only perceive disturbances during the daytime if you pass a Difficult (-10) Perception Test. If you are awakened during the day, you will wake with +1 Fatigued Condition and direct sunlight will affect you as usual. If you fail this Test, you remain unawares provided no one harms you. If anyone touches you or comes within 2 yards of where you are sleeping, you will awaken immediately to defend yourself. After Willpower Bonus minutes, you will have to pass another <strong>Challenging (+0) Endurance Test</strong> to stay awake, or feel the crushing weight of deathly sleep, gaining the Unconscious Condition once more. You should repeat this Test at the same interval until you finally return to sleep. The Fatigued Condition gained from interrupted sleep will only resolve when you make up your missed sleep or feed.</p>\n<p>Example: If you have Willpower Bonus 6, you can remain awake for 3 hours after sunrise. After this, you must sleep for at least 8 hours, or you will awaken with +1 Fatigued Condition which can only be removed through sleep or feeding. You may also choose to rise a number of hours before sunset equal to half your Willpower Bonus, though the requirement for 8 hours' sleep still applies.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<section>\n<section class=\"secret\">\n<h2>Optional Rule:</h2>\n<p>Regaining Resolve Vampires do not have Fate and Fortune (although they sometimes have Dark Fate and Dark Fortune). As such, they rely more on their Resilience and Resolve than mortals. In certain games, this may seem hard-going, since Resolve replenishes much slower than Fortune does. These two optional methods of regaining Resolve may be more to your liking.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The first option is that you can allow Vampires to regain 1 Resolve each sunset when they awake from sleep.</li>\n<li>The second, slightly more generous option, is to allow them to regain all Resolve points at the start of every session, as with Fortune. This latter option may be best in mixed parties, where it's necessary for Vampires to keep up with Humans.</li>\n</ul>\n</section>\n</section>","_id":"VmSEIkQpf0uA4gk2"}

Spending 1 Resolve to remove the Prone Condition also restores 1 Wound, as usual. If you have Bleeding Conditions, these will always heal first, before any Wounds. 1 Bleeding Condition can be healed as if it were 1 Wound instead. Bleeding Conditions healed through feeding do not cause Fatigued Conditions afterwards, as the blood has been replaced.</p>\n<p>For example, you have taken 4 Wounds and 2 Bleeding Conditions, you spend 1 Advantage to make a free Bite attack and deal 3 Wounds after Toughness Bonus and Armour Points. Ordinarily, you would heal 3 Wounds, but as you have 2 Bleeding Conditions, you heal these first and heal 1 Wound afterwards.</p>","_id":"q0EGERQfkxkkxTEy"}
{"name":"Feeding","permission":{"default":0,"kHr5wGqy2Rw4go1y":3},"flags":{},"content":"<h2>Feeding</h2>\n<p>All Vampires feel the thirst for blood. The amount of blood taken is measured in Wounds inflicted by @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.traits.pLW9SVX0TVTYPiPv]{Bite} with a minimum of three wounds dealt (e.g. dealing three wounds to a foe means you have taken three units of blood).&nbsp; Dealing two or less damage with your Bite does not enable you to feed.</p>\n<p>This is further described in the @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.traits.3MDwUi7BVxwWVI2V]{Vampiric} Trait.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Feeding Interval</h2>\n<p>Younger Vampires must feed more frequently. The @Compendium[wfrp4e-vampires.vampires-traits.3oddbuzQ8MqWJ2Z9]{Age} Trait describes the relationship between Vampire age and feeding frequency. The number of intervals is your Toughness Bonus.</p>\n<p>For example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A month-old Vampire with Toughness 45 has a feeding interval of 'Hours' and a Toughness Bonus of 4, therefore they must feed every <strong>four hours</strong> at a minimum (excluding the daytime when you are asleep).</li>\n<li>A three year Vampire with Toughness 60 has a feeding interval of 'Weeks' and a Toughness Bonus of 6, therefore they must feed every&nbsp;<strong>six weeks</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As you can see, older Vampires do not need to feed anywhere near as frequently as younger Vampires.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Even Hungrier</h2>\n<p>If you have not fed for a number of feeding intervals greater than your Toughness Bonus you must make a <strong>Challenging (+0) Cool Test&nbsp;</strong>or gain +1 @Compendium[wfrp4e-vampires.vampires-traits.l0PYm8MRdg2fceiG]{Hungry} trait.</p>\n<p>Each single feeding interval after this that you deny yourself, you must continue to pass <strong>Challenging (+0) Cool Tests</strong> until you feed (the penalties to Willpower Bonus apply here too, so that it becomes increasingly difficult to deny your hunger). Each failed roll adds +1 @Compendium[wfrp4e-vampires.vampires-traits.l0PYm8MRdg2fceiG]{Hungry} trait. Once you reach five Hunger, you also gain the @Compendium[wfrp4e-vampires.vampires-traits.JbBGA0EOhJLPTgab]{Ravenous} Trait.

What if it's treated by a physician?</li>\n<li>Does the Vampire need to drain the victim?</li>\n<li>Do they need to feed the victim their own blood then kill them, only for the victim to reawaken days later?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h1>Transformation</h1>\n<p>You may choose to use one, several, or all of the below steps, in any order.&nbsp;Several steps are automated via macros to make this process easier for you, and when that is applicable the appropriate macros are linked.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Bloodline</h2>\n<p>Your PC is likely to transform into the Bloodline of the Vampire that bit/fed from them. It is not uncommon for a newly-turned Vampire to reject their sire's Bloodline however, with a small number taking the Independent path.</p>\n<p>Rumours exist of newly-turned Vampires belonging to Bloodlines other than that of the Vampire who sired them, and accusations fly of betrayal, but there's no concrete evidence of any such happenings. Perhaps you could find a way to make it work!</p>\n<p><strong>Bloodlines:&nbsp;</strong>@Compendium[wfrp4e-vampires.vampires-journals.grmlehMwani7xUw0]{Species Primer: Blood Dragon}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-vampires.vampires-journals.Mu4uLGvLBp37UX5u]{Species Primer: Lahmian}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-vampires.vampires-journals.oRbM7l1ZCYFkBNgW]{Species Primer: Necrarch}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-vampires.vampires-journals.mm57bcI78BC5yRrf]{Species Primer: Strigoi}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-vampires.vampires-journals.u6LV0ERhY7bLjgXw]{Species Primer: Von Carstein}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-vampires.vampires-journals.AjiVAu7IwEXjqP88]{Species Primer: Independent}</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Vampire Career</h2>\n<p>The PC will most likely already have a career. They are free to keep that career, especially since they'll most likely need to hide their Vampiric nature - possibly even from their own party! Some careers will not be performed well by a Vampire:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A Vampire @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.career-descriptions.g12yhcU74qsRKxXX]{Servant} would struggle to work during the day when their Master required it.</li>\n<li>Vampiric @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.career-descriptions.14nKRAT6nMCMGSUf]{Boatman} might have a weakness that prevents their stepping through or over @Compendium[wfrp4e-vampires.vampires-traits.XK2jviw2VtiUS3Ib]{Running Water}, rendering them useless at the career.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Other careers might benefit greatly from the Vampiric nature:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.career-descriptions.dWLxT0zRnDFbwTKZ]{Spy}'s would benefit greatly from the increased speed, skills, and senses, as would @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.career-descriptions.3A56eFnkIYFmbRL1]{Witch Hunter}'s, who could use the increased strength and power to combat Witches with even greater effectiveness.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>It's up to you and your player to decide if they wish to keep their own career.&nbsp;</strong>Vampire careers do exist, however they are overwhelmingly for Vampires taking part in the Vampiric society, and as such might not fit well into existing parties of non-Vampires.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Careers:&nbsp;</strong>@Compendium[wfrp4e-vampires.vampires-journals.ehNNFJIUe14psxC2]{Blood Knight}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-vampires.vampires-journals.sinmjz4zcWPcmSvF]{Handmaiden}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-vampires.vampires-journals.YTqhNv9oY8YrjC7S]{Lector}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-vampires.vampires-journals.dbSUyQYsHHTVqSWE]{Night Raider}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-vampires.vampires-journals.g2K6L7KdtQUeBK98]{Vampire Count}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-vampires.vampires-journals.LM32MzJyJWy32Gl8]{Ghoul Master}.</p>\n<p>Certain careers are restricted by Bloodline - a Blood Dragon shall not become a Handmaiden!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Characteristics</h2>\n<p>Vampires' characteristics change depending on which Bloodline they are sired into.

The amount of blood taken is measured in Wounds inflicted by @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.traits.pLW9SVX0TVTYPiPv]{Bite} with a minimum of three wounds dealt (e.g. dealing three wounds to a foe means you have taken three units of blood).&nbsp; Dealing two or less damage with your Bite does not enable you to feed.</p>\n<p>This is further described in the @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.traits.3MDwUi7BVxwWVI2V]{Vampiric} Trait.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Feeding Interval</h2>\n<p>Younger Vampires must feed more frequently. The @Compendium[wfrp4e-vampires.vampires-traits.3oddbuzQ8MqWJ2Z9]{Age} Trait describes the relationship between Vampire age and feeding frequency. The number of intervals is your Toughness Bonus.</p>\n<p>For example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A month-old Vampire with Toughness 45 has a feeding interval of 'Hours' and a Toughness Bonus of 4, therefore they must feed every <strong>four hours</strong> at a minimum (excluding the daytime when you are asleep).</li>\n<li>A three year Vampire with Toughness 60 has a feeding interval of 'Weeks' and a Toughness Bonus of 6, therefore they must feed every&nbsp;<strong>six weeks</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As you can see, older Vampires do not need to feed anywhere near as frequently as younger Vampires.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Even Hungrier</h2>\n<p>If you have not fed for a number of feeding intervals greater than your Toughness Bonus you must make a <strong>Challenging (+0) Cool Test&nbsp;</strong>or gain +1 @Compendium[wfrp4e-vampires.vampires-traits.l0PYm8MRdg2fceiG]{Hungry} trait.</p>\n<p>Each single feeding interval after this that you deny yourself, you must continue to pass <strong>Challenging (+0) Cool Tests</strong> until you feed (the penalties to Willpower Bonus apply here too, so that it becomes increasingly difficult to deny your hunger). Each failed roll adds +1 @Compendium[wfrp4e-vampires.vampires-traits.l0PYm8MRdg2fceiG]{Hungry} trait. Once you reach five Hunger, you also gain the @Compendium[wfrp4e-vampires.vampires-traits.JbBGA0EOhJLPTgab]{Ravenous} Trait. These Traits stack and can only be removed by feeding.</p>"}
